# CLAUDE.md — SimGolf RE

Reverse engineering of **Sid Meier's SimGolf** (Firaxis / Maxis / EA, 2002), v1.03, built on the
Mashed RE workflow (`..\Mashed\CLAUDE.md`): Ghidra + Frida, NO-GUESSING, the C0..C4 confidence
ladder, signature-checked patches, and a test suite that boots the real game.

**Shape of the project: hook-based, not greenfield.** The stock game runs; our code lives in a shim
DLL that fixes Windows 11 compatibility, applies patches, and hosts reimplementations that are A/B
tested against the original inside the live process.

## Anchors (verify before citing any address)

All in `re/anchors.json`, enforced by `tests/test_static.py`.

```
original\golf_clean.exe  2,286,953  E74EA9F95350796432CB1CCDA3BFFE00E48789F3E410CD5FFB61F70ACEB26789   <- THE TARGET
original\golf.exe        2,286,953  200711A655DEB60DD63B2C379B25086B90CBF9A0B8C8BCC5427B224201BAC0A2   (SafeDisc 2.60.52, v1.03)

```

`golf_clean.exe` = `golf.exe` v1.03 unwrapped by Safedisc2Cleaner. Image base `0x00400000`, no
relocations, so addresses are VAs. DLL addresses are RVAs (the `module` column says which).
**Never modify `golf_clean.exe` on disk**: it is the A/B reference. Patches go through the shim.

## Engine and binaries

- **Jackal** engine (Firaxis; Alpha Centauri lineage: `jackal.txt` still has SMAC error strings).
- `jgld.dll` — 2D GDI/DIB graphics, window, fonts (debug build, `C:\JackDev\Debug\jgld.pdb`; U-0001).
- `Terrain.dll` — OpenGL 3D terrain; exports the `Terrain` class (golf imports 26 methods).
- `sound.dll` — DirectSound/winmm. `binkw32.dll` — RAD Bink 1.x video.
- `golf_clean.exe` exports 4 Terrain accessors (`tileAt`, `getElevation`, `getWall`, `getType`) that
  are **dead code** (0 runtime calls); the live ones are in `Terrain.dll`.
- Compiler: linker 6.0 (MSVC 6) for all three. `Terrain.dll` and `jgld.dll` are **debug** builds
  (stack fill `0xcccccccc`, incremental-linking `jmp` thunks: exports point at thunks, not bodies).
- `golf_v100_clean.exe` (retail v1.00, SafeDisc 2.51.021 unwrapped) is in the Ghidra master for version
  diffing only: `re/versions/PATCH_MAP.md` links v1.01-1.03 patch notes to changed functions.

## Runtime (how it runs on Win11) — details in `re/analysis/PORTABLE_RUNTIME.md`

`Play SimGolf.bat` -> `original\golf_clean.exe` + `original\winmm.dll` (our shim, a winmm proxy).
No installer, no registry (no game module imports ADVAPI32), no SafeDisc, windowed 800x600.

Shim (`shim/`, build `shim\build.bat`, MSVC x86 + vendored MinHook). Config `original\simgolf_shim.ini`,
env overrides `SIMGOLF_*`, log `original\simgolf_shim.log`:
- `windowed=1` — suppress `ChangeDisplaySettingsA`, fake 800x600 screen metrics, framed window, no `ClipCursor`.
- `bink_dib=1` — force `BINKBUFFERDIBSECTION`; `BINKBUFFERAUTO` crashes inside `BinkBufferOpen` on Win11.
- `skip_intro=0` — tests set `SIMGOLF_SKIP_INTRO=1` (menu in ~4.5 s).
- `patches/*.ini` — signature-checked byte patches (`expect` must match or the patch is refused).
- `shim/src/re/*.cpp` — reimplementations, `SG_HOOK(module, addr, name, detour, orig)`, toggle with
  `[hooks] <addr>=0` or `SIMGOLF_HOOKS_OFF=<addr>,...|all`.
- Test exports: `SimGolfShim_SetVirtualCursor`, `SimGolfShim_FindHook`, `SimGolfShim_GetInfo`,
  `SimGolfShim_CovPhase`/`CovDump` (INT3 function coverage, `SIMGOLF_COVERAGE=<entries file>`).
  `SIMGOLF_VCURSOR=x,y` makes the virtual cursor live from the first frame (the harness always sets it).
  `SimGolfShim_SetVirtualKey(vk, 0|1|2)` overlays GetKeyboardState/GetKeyState/GetAsyncKeyState: the
  in-game UI reads mouse buttons from GetKeyboardState (~13/s), which posted messages never update.
- `SIMGOLF_TIMEWARP=N` scales timeGetTime/GetTickCount/QueryPerformanceCounter (x32 + Esc every 2 s =
  ~1 game year per 40 s; event popups such as SimFoto hold game time until Esc clears them).

## Toolchain

- Ghidra 12.0.3 shared from `..\TD5RE\ghidra\ghidra_12.0.3_PUBLIC` (do not duplicate); MCP
  `ghidra-headless-mcp` from `..\TD5RE\ghidra\headless-mcp\` and `frida-game-hacking` — both wired in
  `.mcp.json` (same as Mashed; a new session picks them up).
- Python 3.12 (`py -3.12`): frida 17, pefile, capstone, pywinauto, pillow, numpy, pytest.
- MSVC Build Tools 2022 x86 (`vcvars32.bat`) for the shim.
- **Visual C++ 6** (cl 12.00.8168, the exact build in the game's Rich headers) in `tools/vc6/vc98`
  (extracted from the user's `Visual Studio 6.iso`, no installer; not committed). Used only by
  `re/tools/match.py` for matching decompilation.

### Matching decompilation
`re/match/*.cpp` hold canonical sources with `// MATCH: <module> <addr> <decorated name>` and per-module
`// FLAGS <module>: ...`. `py -3.12 re/tools/match.py re/match/<file>.cpp` compiles with VC6, compares
normalized instructions against the anchored binary, writes `log/diff/<addr>_<name>.match.csv`.
Flags found so far: `golf_clean.exe` `/O2` (or `/Ox`, indistinguishable so far); `Terrain.dll`
`/Od /ZI /GZ /GX` (debug, C++ EH on: `getInstance` has an SEH frame; /GX changes nothing else).
26 functions at 100% (all 4 Terrain accessors in both builds, 19 of the 22 live exported Terrain.dll
methods incl. initSystem/resize/calcAllNormals/tileHit). Remaining live exports: drawLine, localRender, render.
The shim links VC6 output: `shimuild_vc6.bat` compiles `re/match/terrain.cpp` (/O2 /Zl) and
`/DSG_VC6_TERRAIN` makes it the tileAt detour (the original 57 bytes appear verbatim in winmm.dll). Debug builds compile almost literally, so they reveal source shape the release
optimizer erased (e.g. Terrain accessors delegate to inline `Tile` methods). When several spellings
compile identically, record that the source is NOT determined there. 100% match = C4 evidence.

### Ghidra project

Master `SimGolf.gpr` holds `golf_clean.exe` (2,207 functions after analysis), `jgld.dll`,
`Terrain.dll`, `sound.dll`. Rebuild recipe (~4 min):
```
<ghidra>\support\analyzeHeadless.bat C:\Users\maria\Desktop\Proyectos\SimGolf SimGolf ^
  -import original\golf_clean.exe original\jgld.dll original\Terrain.dll original\sound.dll
```
Use the `ghidra-pool` skill for slots. Without the MCP: `py -3.12 re\tools\decomp.py 0x<addr>`.

## Tests (`test-suite` skill)

```
py -3.12 -m pytest -m static                  # anchors, SafeDisc removal, portability, shim surface, gate unit tests
py -3.12 -m pytest -m "runtime and not slow"  # boots the game windowed; Frida; input; in-game; patches; A/B tool
py -3.12 -m pytest -m ghidra                  # master project, headless facts via a pool slot, MCP tools/list
py -3.12 -m pytest -m slow                    # 5x boot reliability, full intro through the Bink fix
```

## Workflow rules

### NO-GUESSING
Report only what the decompilation/disassembly literally shows; cite the address of every constant
and offset; raw hex + signed decimal for sign-sensitive values; unclear -> `[UNCERTAIN U-NNNN]`
filed in `UNCERTAINTIES.md`. Banned: *probably, likely, seems to, appears to, I think, presumably,
might be, maybe* (the gate rejects notes containing them). Verify claims you write: the first note
here claimed `Terrain.dll` called the exe's `tileAt`; the import table and a runtime counter said no.

### Confidence ladder (`re-classify` skill)
`re/CONFIDENCE.md` is the rubric; `scripts/re_classify.py` is the only writer of `hooks.csv` and
`re/analysis/CHANGELOG.md`. One level at a time. C3 needs a GREEN path-1 A/B with install witness and
an anti-island caller and callee. C4 needs a canonical-scenario ON/OFF run (D-0002). Path-1 is never
C4 evidence.

### A/B verification (`diff-original` skill)
Add vectors to `re/frida/hooks_registry.py`, run `py -3.12 re/frida/diff_hook.py <name>`. Never write
one-off harnesses; extend the registry. For live functions prefer **record/replay**:
`py -3.12 re/frida/record.py <name>` (real calls + memory, hook OFF) then `py -3.12 re/frida/replay.py <name>`
(Unicorn, offline: live == emulated original == reimpl). `re/tools/invariants.py <name>` infers contracts
from the recording that neighbours can be checked against.

### Scoreboard, coverage, version diff, failures
- `py -3.12 scripts/scoreboard.py` — Reach x Understanding x Verification per function; priority list.
- `py -3.12 re/tools/coverage_census.py --runs 3` — INT3 census of the sandbox scenario (exe + Terrain.dll).
- `py -3.12 re/tools/version_diff.py re/versions/v100.jsonl re/versions/v103.jsonl` — function matching.
- `re/tools/sbfl.py` (Ochiai), `re/tools/cov_bisect.py` (ddmin; needs a deterministic oracle).
- Read `re/analysis/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` before trusting any FAIL: first decide harness vs game.

### Scenarios (`re/tools/scenario.py`)
`sandbox_basic` (menu -> Sandbox -> Monterey, 40 s), `course_season` (+ build tee/green with the Build
Course palette, open the hole with `H`, 240 s at x32 = ~6 game years), `championship` (installs the
fixture course `tests/fixtures/championship/`, Play a Championship -> Easy -> course -> Gary Golf ->
tournament with leaderboard; Gary's own shots wait for player input, not driven yet).
Census: `py -3.12 re/tools/coverage_census.py --scenario <name>`; union so far exe 805/2207, Terrain.dll 422/1050.
Input gotchas: posted mouse lParam is rescaled by Windows from the DPI-aware harness to the DPI-unaware
game (send physical coords: `Game._lp`); keys need WM_CHAR too; right click drops a build tool.

### Screenshots
`Game.shot()` BitBlts from the window DC (DWM redirection surface, unscaled 800x600, works for GDI and
OpenGL and while covered). Never grab screen pixels: another window on top produced false "hangs";
`PrintWindow` returned black frames 8-18% of the time (2026-10-02).

### Process hygiene
The game is **single-instance** (a second copy exits after ~2 s). Track the PID you spawn and kill
only that one. `Game.start()` refuses to run while another SimGolf window exists. Never blanket-kill
by name.

### Patching
Patches are `patches/<name>.ini` with `expect` bytes taken from the anchored binary. Default
`enabled=0` unless it is a compat fix. Cite the analysis note in `desc`. The static test validates
every committed patch against the anchors.

## Delegation

Workspace policy (`..\CLAUDE.md`): read-only surveys go to the account2 worker via `delegate.ps1`.
Ghidra MCP, Frida, builds, game runs, tracker writes stay local.

## Happy info pane
Keep `.happy/project-info.json` current when a standing fact changes (status, counts, key dates).
